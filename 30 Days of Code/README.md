### Notes on Style

Since readers of this tutorial are probably somewhat new to programming, my solutions to this particular set of challenges prioritize **code readability** over small gains in efficiency or robustness.

That is, the type of long, dense, or convoluted "one-liner" solutions that some programmers enjoy showing off are not presented here, and input is assumed to mostly follow the constraints stated in each challenge.

### Encouraging Good Practices

The code stubs and solutions HackerRank provides for many of these challenges sometimes encourage bad coding habits. These include hardcoded values and some non-standard naming/indentation schemes. To help show beginners the light, my solutions adhere more strictly to general community standards of clean, maintainble code.

I've included comments in the source code near any questionable practices encouraged by these tutorials that my solutions do **not** address. For example, Day 02 encourages using double-precision floating point values for currency manipulation; instead of converting to a more suitable representation (and confusing beginners in the process), I just noted the issue in a comment.
